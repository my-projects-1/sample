Great question! **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) itself cannot be directly configured in IIS** — because IIS is just a web server. But here's what you *can* do with IIS in the context of enforcing MFA:

---

### **1. IIS + Windows Authentication + AD FS**
If you're using **Windows Authentication in IIS**, you can configure **AD FS** as the identity provider and enforce MFA *through AD FS*, not directly in IIS.

#### Workflow:
1. User tries to access IIS app.
2. App (or IIS) redirects to AD FS (via WS-Federation).
3. AD FS authenticates user and enforces MFA (based on policies).
4. Token is returned and user is signed in.

> IIS is just the host — the MFA logic happens in **AD FS** (or Azure AD).

---

### **2. IIS + Azure AD (via OpenID Connect/OAuth2)**
If your .NET app is configured for **Azure AD authentication** (via OpenID Connect middleware), then:
- The app redirects users to **Azure AD**.
- **Azure Conditional Access** can enforce MFA.
- IIS simply serves the app.

---

### **3. Can IIS Enforce MFA On Its Own?**
No. IIS:
- Can enforce **Windows Authentication**, **Basic**, **Forms**, etc.
- Can be configured with third-party authentication modules.
- **Cannot do MFA natively**.

To enforce MFA, **you must use**:
- An **identity provider** (like AD FS, Azure AD, Okta)
- Or a **custom module** in your app that connects to one

---

### **In Short:**
| Feature | IIS | AD FS / Azure AD |
|--------|-----|------------------|
| MFA Enforcement | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Redirection for Login | ✅ Possible | ✅ Yes |
| Authentication Logic | ❌ Limited | ✅ Full control |

Want to set this up with **Azure AD** or **AD FS** + IIS specifically? I can guide step-by-step based on your app.








Exactly! Let’s break it down with practical steps for **Azure AD** and **AD FS** so you can enforce MFA in each scenario.

---

## **1. Azure AD – Enforce MFA using Conditional Access**

### **Steps:**
1. **Go to Azure Portal**  
   [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)

2. **Navigate to:**
   `Azure Active Directory` > `Security` > `Conditional Access`

3. **Create a new policy:**
   - **Name:** e.g., "MFA for Web App"
   - **Users or groups:** Select users or groups this should apply to.
   - **Cloud apps or actions:** Choose the app you registered (e.g., your web app/client ID).
   - **Conditions (Optional):** Filter by device/platform/location.
   - **Access controls > Grant:**  
     Select **“Grant access”**  
     Check **“Require multi-factor authentication”**
   - **Enable Policy:** On

4. **Save the policy**

Once this is applied, **any user accessing the app** will be redirected to Azure AD, and MFA will be enforced based on your conditions.

## **2. AD FS – Enforce MFA using Access Control Policies**

### **Steps (Server Manager):**
1. Open **AD FS Management Console**

2. Go to:
   `Trust Relationships` > `Relying Party Trusts`

3. Right-click your **Relying Party Trust** (your app) and select **Edit Access Control Policy**

4. Choose or create a policy like:
   - **“Permit everyone and require MFA”**
   - Or a custom rule:
     - Permit users from specific groups and require MFA.

5. Click **Apply**

### **MFA Options in AD FS:**
- Built-in AD FS MFA providers (like Windows Hello or Azure MFA extension)
- Third-party MFA plugins

If you're using the **Azure MFA extension for AD FS**, make sure it's installed and configured properly.

---

### **TL;DR**
- **Azure AD:** Use **Conditional Access** to enforce MFA per app/user.
- **AD FS:** Use **Access Control Policies** to require MFA at the Relying Party level.
