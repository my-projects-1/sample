Thanks for the clarification — here's a **direct and clean solution** that meets **all your requirements**:

---

## ✅ Your Requirements Recap

- **.NET 6 Core app** with **Windows Kerberos Authentication**
- You want to add **MFA** **before access is allowed**
- ✅ **No code changes** in the application
- ✅ Preferably handled **via IIS or infrastructure**
- 🚫 No changing to OIDC/SAML inside the app

---

## ✅ Solution Summary: **Use Reverse Proxy + Pre-authentication**

You can **enforce MFA at the IIS level** *without modifying your app* by placing a **reverse proxy or pre-authentication layer in front of the app**, using one of these two approaches:

---

## 🔹 Option 1: **Azure AD Application Proxy + MFA (Recommended)**

### ✅ Key Benefits
- No code changes
- Kerberos/Windows Auth remains on the backend
- Azure AD handles all MFA + SSO
- Works fully through IIS + cloud agent

---

### 🔧 Step-by-Step: Azure AD App Proxy

#### 1. **Install Azure AD Application Proxy Connector**
- Install on a domain-joined Windows server (not necessarily the IIS server)
- Download: [Azure AD Application Proxy Connector](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/app-proxy/application-proxy-connectors)

#### 2. **Publish the App via Azure Portal**
- Go to **Azure Active Directory > Enterprise Applications > + New Application**
- Choose **"On-premises application"**
- Configure:
  - **Internal URL**: `http://your-iis-server`
  - **External URL**: Azure AD-generated (e.g., `https://yourapp.msappproxy.net`)
  - Pre-authentication: **Azure Active Directory**
  - Assign required **users/groups**

#### 3. **Enable MFA with Conditional Access**
- Go to **Azure AD > Security > Conditional Access**
- Create a policy targeting your app:
  - Assign users/groups
  - Conditions (optional)
  - **Grant access only if MFA is passed**
- Enable the policy

#### 4. **Restrict Backend Access**
- Restrict IIS so only traffic from Azure AD Proxy Connector is allowed

---

### 🔁 What Happens at Runtime

1. User visits `https://yourapp.msappproxy.net`
2. Azure AD intercepts the request → performs MFA
3. Azure Proxy tunnels request to internal IIS
4. IIS still authenticates using **Windows Kerberos**
5. App loads as normal, no code changes

---

## 🔸 Option 2: **Web Application Proxy (WAP) + ADFS + MFA (On-Premises Alternative)**

If you can’t use Azure, use **WAP + ADFS** to enforce MFA before your app:

#### Setup Summary
1. Install **ADFS** and configure MFA (e.g., Azure MFA NPS extension)
2. Install **WAP** in perimeter/DMZ
3. Configure WAP to:
   - Pre-authenticate via ADFS
   - Publish your app to external users
4. Only allow WAP access to your IIS server (internal Kerberos still works)

✅ This way, your internal app stays untouched and protected by MFA before requests even hit it.

| Feature                      | Azure AD Proxy        | WAP + ADFS              |
|------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Code Changes Required        | ❌ None                | ❌ None                  |
| Works with Windows Auth      | ✅ Yes                 | ✅ Yes                   |
| Adds MFA                     | ✅ Yes (Conditional Access) | ✅ Yes (ADFS Policies)     |
| Cloud Dependency             | ✅ Yes                 | ❌ No (On-prem)          |
| Setup Complexity             | ⚪ Medium              | 🔴 Higher                |

## 🔽 Want Help Setting This Up?

Let me know:
- Are you in an **Azure-connected environment** (Azure AD, synced users)?
- Do you have **on-prem ADFS or plans to set it up**?
- Do you want a **network diagram** or checklist to pass to your infra team?

I can help you generate a customized deployment plan.
